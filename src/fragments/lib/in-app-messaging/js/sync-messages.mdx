The first step to getting In-App messages in front of your appâ€™s active users is make sure all available In-App messaging campaign messages are synced to their device, which would be triggered when an analytics or In-App messaging event is triggered. Amplify In-App Messaging empowers you with the control of when and how often you perform this sync.

```js
await InAppMessaging.syncMessages();
```

<Callout informational>
  NOTE: Syncing messages will always overwrite existing messages currently on
  their device so they are always up to date when the sync is performed.
