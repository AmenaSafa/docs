Once messages have been synced to your user’s device, you may find that you want to clear them out for any reason. `InAppMessaging.clearMessages()` can be used to clear the synced messages from the user’s device.

```js
await InAppMessaging.clearMessages();
```

<Callout informational>
  NOTE: If your app has authentication implemented, we recommend calling
  InAppMessaging.clearMessages() in between user log-ins to remove messages
  targeted for specific specific user segments. This is especially important if
  you anticipate your application will be used in shared device scenarios.
